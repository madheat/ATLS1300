# ATLS1300
ATLS 1300 SP20 CU Boulder

This was my contribution to the final project of creating a generative art gallery. One script creates a triangle vortex that uses different colors of yellow, and the other does something similar but creates a star shape. 
To run, download both .py files and run in a GUI such as Spyder.
